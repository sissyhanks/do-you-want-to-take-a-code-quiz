# Do you want to take a code quiz?

## The most horrifying quiz on the net!

This quiz was built as a canvas to experiment and see what kinds of effects I could create with the JavaScript skills I have developed so far. I learned the importance of unifying data types while working with information returned from objects. My understanding of loops, randomization, and event listeners blossomed while working on this quiz. I had so much fun traversing the DOM, appending and creating and appending elements to make quiz mascot Jugsaw (no relation to Jigsaw) chase the user through the pages of the site.

I also learned that 9 times out of tem it is better to type out code rather than copy it and that even if the script is working a change to one part can pop up and make another part unreadable.
